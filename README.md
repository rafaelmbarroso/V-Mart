*"Project Marketplace"*
# V-Mart
*A student focused community thrifting app*

## Project Brief
Every semester, students on or off campus get rid of things they may not need.
This may range from books, supplies, and maybe even furniture of computers. Regardless of 
what they may need to get rid of, there's likely another student in need that could make use of
need the very thing that other student is looking to get rid of.

## Project Concept
Our proposed marketplace app is meant for students to reach out to other students and make 
arrangements to acquire or give out items which they no longer need or that they themselves need.

## Technical/Specifications
- Framework: We'll be using the Django & Tailwindcss frameworks for this project.
- Database: We'll be using SQLite as our database for this project.

Final Name = V-Mart Marketplace

## FrameWork Methodology

For the framework the idea was to figure out how our app was going to work. Figma was used as a way to facilitate the design process. The figma was just a visual representation of how we wanted our "views" to look. Features are subject to change, functionalities may be added or deleted from what the prototype displayed.

## Front End Framwork

For the rest of this project we plan to switch to using Tailwindcss over bootstrap for our front end framework. This is due to tailwinds' felxibility on the design process
