*"Project Marketplace"*
# V-Mart
*A student focused community thrifting app*

## Project Brief
Every semester, students on or off campus get rid of things they may not need.
This may range from books, supplies, and maybe even furniture of computers. Regardless of 
what they may need to get rid of, there's likely another student in need that could make use of
need the very thing that other student is looking to get rid of.

## Project Concept
Our proposed marketplace app is meant for students to reach out to other students and make 
arrangements to acquire or give out items which they no longer need or that they themselves need.

## Technical/Specifications
- Framework: We'll be using the Django & Bootstrap frameworks for this project.
